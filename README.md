Blackjack is played with card deck/s and each face card has a value of 10
All number cards has their face value while Ace can be either 11 or 1.
Don't worry about Ace, program will decide how best to put it in use
Game starts with a card dealt to both dealer and player upwards.
Round 2 will be dealt with cards facedown. You would only know your card.
From round 3, you can either hit i.e. take a card, or stand i.e. stay put.
Strategy should be to get to 21 or as close as possible to it.
Winning rate is 3:2 for blackjack while 1:1 for regular wins
If you get a 21 i.e. blackjack you win right away
If you go beyond 21 you are busted and you loose your bet
If you choose to stand on any other number, dealer plays his turn in a similar fashion
If both stand, whoever has a value closer to 21 wins.
If both have same total, no one wins. You get to keep your bet
